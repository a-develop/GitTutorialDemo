git bash is a linux based command line tool.
pwd->present working dir
ls->list all dir and file in that dir
cd dir_name/ --> to enter that dir


git--> command line tool for cmd,power shell and git bash
pwd--> for git bash(present working directory)
git config --global user.name "Alok" --> Setting the user name globally
git config --global user.email "thealokraj16@gmail.com" --> Setting the user email id.
git config --list --> to get the list of all configration value
git config --global core.editor vim--> setting the viw editor but work in linux only.
git status -->check the status of git repo.
git init --> Initializating a repo to a git repo(first step)
git add --a --> To put all file in the stazing area at a time.
git commit --> commit the all file in stagging area without any message
git commit -m "you message" -> commit the all file in staging area with your meaage.
git log --> To check all logs of current repo.
git add file_name _with_extension --> To add that particular file in stagging area.
rm -rf .git --> this will delete the .git hidden repo due to which our repo will no lognner is  a git repo.
becauge git init make a .git repo which make a repo to git repo.
clonning a github repo
go to github and copy the link and bake to your dir
git clone you_copy_url_from_github youname_to_repo(optional)--> this will make
git submodule add <url> you_name--> to add a naother git repo inside a  git repo as a submodule.
.gitignore --> if you name a file in this file with extension then that file will not be track by git anymore.
but you have to track the .gitignore file. so keep this in mind.
If you have multiple simle extenion file which have to ignaore then instead of adding each of them in .gitignore file simply write *.extension to ignore all the file.here * means all
and if you have some other extension also you can add them manually also but try to ignore similar extension file by *.extension.
If you want ot ignore a directory then simply in .gitignore file add directory_name/ to ignore that particule director and all the files in that directory.
git by difault ignore the blank repo. keep this in mind. 
*.extenion in .gitignore will ignore that extension file in any repo.
the same rule apply for reponame/ in .gitignore file.
but if want to ignore only outer file the user /reponame/ in .gitignore.
you can also specify the path like static/image.
so .gitignore can be complex also. Try it your own.
git add . --> try to fine this
git diff--> Difference between stagging area and working repo.
git diff --staged--> Dfference between stagging area and previous commit.
git commit -a -m "message"--> commit only the tracked file by skipping the stagging area.
trak file means thos file which are not new added or a file which has been sent to staged area before this anytime.
If you have add a new file then at least add that file in stazed area at once or start tracking hte file.
pagger--> when we do git log we can see all commit in page wise that is called git pagger which can be exit by typing q only
git rm filenameWith Extension--> to remove the file and also adding them to stazing area i.e we don't need to add them in stazing area explicitly. Directly you can do commit.
git mv oldfilename newfilename--> rename the file and add to stagging area also. ready to commit
git rm --cached filenamewithextension--> to make the file untrack. if you a file in .gitignore then make sure that is not track by git befor. if track then remove from tracking.
tracking start once we put a file in staging area.
git log -p--> logs with ditails of changes
git log -p -2--> only two log with details of changes
git log -2--> only two log 
git log --stat-->logs with ditails of changes in short
git log --pretty=oneline--> all hash value with commit message
git log --pretty=short--> all hash value with commit message and author name
git log --pretty=full-->all hash value with commit message and author name and who has done the commit.
