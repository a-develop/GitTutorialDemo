git commit -m "you message" -> commit the all file in staging area with your meaage.
git log --> To check all logs of current repo.
git add file_name _with_extension --> To add that particular file in stagging area.
rm -rf .git --> this will delete the .git hidden repo due to which our repo will no lognner is  a git repo.
becauge git init make a .git repo which make a repo to git repo.
clonning a github repo
go to github and copy the link and bake to your dir
git clone you_copy_url_from_github youname_to_repo(optional)--> this will make
git submodule add <url> you_name--> to add a naother git repo inside a  git repo as a submodule.
.gitignore --> if you name a file in this file with extension then that file will not be track by git anymore.
but you have to track the .gitignore file. so keep this in mind.
If you have multiple simle extenion file which have to ignaore then instead of adding each of them in .gitignore file simply write *.extension to ignore all the file.here * means all
and if you have some other extension also you can add them manually also but try to ignore similar extension file by *.extension.
If you want ot ignore a directory then simply in .gitignore file add directory_name/ to ignore that particule director and all the files in that directory.
git by difault ignore the blank repo. keep this in mind. 
*.extenion in .gitignore will ignore that extension file in any repo.
the same rule apply for reponame/ in .gitignore file.
but if want to ignore only outer file the user /reponame/ in .gitignore.
you can also specify the path like static/image.
so .gitignore can be complex also. Try it your own.
git add . --> try to fine this
